Experimenting with basic neural networks.

Perused the following first:

A lot of this follows Michael Nielsen's Neural Networks and Deep Learning, almost verbatim.

However, I implemented things from scratch, by hand, so as to test my knowledge of the concepts.

I started in Python, using [his examples](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) as a basis.

Then I moved to C++, to see how well I could translate things to an environment with less hand holding.
